To test my spellchecker, I used the netcat program as a client. When testing, I used multiple instances of clients requesting spell check services at the same
time, i.e. multiple clients. These clients are running from multiple computer system simultaneously. I connected to the client using the command Nc 127.0.0.1 8888.
Then, I was able to run my program using ./spellchecker 8888.
